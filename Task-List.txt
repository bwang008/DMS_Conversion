To DO
------

Collect gbasim snapshot of Existing substations + Johana/Santiago Stations + Jersey/San Miguel around 2-4 PM.

------

"Check AnalogPoints on existing Stations, see if there are any measurements that do not follow the format:"
"MW point contains ""MW"""
"MVAR point contains ""MVAR"""
"A PHASE AMP point contains ""IA"", ""CURRENT A"", ""AMP-A"", or ""AMP A"""

This can be accomplished with a query.

---------

Build ShuntTypes by entering susceptance values... 
Need to reference calculation and susceptance values table to do so.

"Require all cap sizes at substation level (I believe they are 3k, 4.8k, and 6k, but you should query all substation shunts within the database to confirm sizing variance.)"
Something that looks like:
16.0KV_3150
"i.e. (KV level + ""KV_"" + KVAR SIZE)"

----------

Tune the transformers @ Jersey. They are currently all copies of CROWN so they're all referencing the same DeviceLimit and TransformerType. Create a new device limit and transformer type for each transformer.
Create a SRD and DevXref_Device for BK.1 @ Jersey and place analog point measurements onto it. 

----------

Verify if we need the correct red-book values inserted into the injection points.... We did not purchase FLA. IS there ever going to be a plan?

---------

Build macro to generate injection point for existing transformers... From Psa_Transformer.csv file

Also look into generating DMS_Transformer.csv from Psa_Transformer... Need to understand the variability in Transformer Types.
