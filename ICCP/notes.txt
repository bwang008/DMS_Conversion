Check against DMS and verify which points have NOT been moved yet into the system. These objects will most likely need to be added into the DMS system.

Check extract against individual extract of orange county points and verify which points are NOT in first extract. Point requests may need to be created for the gaps.

Of the gaps, if any exist, double check against EMS/DMS that the point does not already exist as a request under another object without the 'DMS' tag on the object name.

Assign data sets to the points which have no data sets in the original EMS pciccp extract. Updates will need to be pushed out for these.
